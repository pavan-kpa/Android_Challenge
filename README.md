# Personio Mobile - Android Coding Challenge

This repository contains a Android starter project that implements a small app which lists candidates application data for our recruiting product.

This will be the starting point for the live-coding challenge in your application process for the Android developer role at Personio.

## Features

The starter project includes the following features:

- A basic project built in Android Studio which uses build tools version 34 and targets Android 21 as its minimum.
- Model with simple networking has been built which pulls data from our [test url](https://personio-fe-coding-challenge.vercel.app/api/candidates)
- A list of candidates wrapped  which uses the aforementioned data and displays it in a human readable format
- An unfinished candidate detail view which displays the information for a candidate on its own
- Some basic views for displaying those results with minimal testing

## Technologies

The starter project includes the following technologies:

- Android Studio
- Kotlin
- Gradle
- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
- The project has also opted into [Material3](https://m3.material.io/) APIs

If you are unfamiliar with these, we can walk you through them but overall they shouldn't need to be modified for the purpose of the intended exercise. You can, of course, change them if you feel like it.

## Running the project

This project was made in Android Studio (Giraffe | 2022.3.1 Patch 1) so opening the project in AS and allowing gradle to sync should reproduce a running application. All of the settings have been left to defaults so it should be familiar to to you.
